              "It is quite clear that the supervisor just wants to get the job done his way and leave. This attitude does not encourage the technician to engage with the pre-job planning process. Note that arriving late will not encourage the technician to question the supervisor.",

This information should be in the risk assessment, and should have been pre-planned (at the office). The team are not accounting for edges within their workplace, not thinking of how to rig their ropes to avoid them, and are not giving all hazards enough thought or respect.",
